A modern Gutenberg block that provides a customizable language switcher for multilingual websites with Polylang integration. 

== Description ==

Language Switcher is a plugin that adds a language-switcher component to the WordPress Gutenberg editor.
Language Switcher requires that the 'Polylang' plugin is installed and activated. 
The Lanugae Switcher Block retrieves available translations for the current page and shows them in a list. 
If there are no available translations (when a page only exists in 1 language), the list is hidden.

1. Download the plugin zip.
